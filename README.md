# NOTE

This is our first time to make a website. These are the shortcomings on our website :

1. Mobile Version, we just realized that the mobile version of our website had this problem after we uploaded it.
   Due to the lack of time we can't fix this problem, because we still have other assignments that are close to the deadline.

2. Virtual photobooth section, we haven't been able to make a button to take a picture because we haven't managed to make this feature ourselves.
   We also haven't been able to make a selection of the background on this feature either.

Thank you.
